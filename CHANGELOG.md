# Changelog

All notable changes to Orbit Pi are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Integrated terminal — a real login shell in a resizable bottom panel (⌘J or
  the top-bar toggle), independent of the right side pane. Built on
  `alacritty_terminal` for PTY and VT/ANSI emulation, rendered natively by
  GPUI: scrollback, click-drag selection with ⌘C/⌘V, bracketed paste, a
  blinking cursor, and a per-theme ANSI palette. The shell follows the active
  workspace and restarts when it changes.

## [0.0.2] - 2026-09-16

### Added

- Native macOS menu bar (Orbit / File / Edit / View) wired to the app's
  existing actions; ⌘N and the About surface now have a real home.

## [0.0.1] - 2026-09-14

### Added

- Chat-style `pi` sessions — streaming transcript, model selection, thinking
  effort, follow-up queueing, mid-run steering, and cancel.
- Sessions grouped by project, reopenable and clonable, with an Orbit-owned
  project list that leaves `pi`'s own session store untouched.
- Access guard — Supervised / Auto-accept edits / Full access, enforced by a
  bundled `tool_call` extension with an inline Allow once / Always allow this
  tool / Deny bar.
- Review pane with a live `git diff HEAD`, and a Git page for Changes /
  History / Graph with staging and commit.
- Workbench pages — usage, skills, plugins, models, providers, and appearance,
  read from `pi`'s on-disk data.
- In-transcript find (⌘F) and a full-window image lightbox.
- Native macOS app bundle, Developer-ID signed and notarizable.
